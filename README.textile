*GZipped*: 631 bytes
*Minified*: 1079 bytes
*Compatibility*: Tested in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, IE6+, basically doing nothing too fancy.
*Examples*: "http://berklee.github.com/nbl/example.html":http://berklee.github.com/nbl/example.html

h2. What is NBL.js?

NBL.js is a tiny script that will make your HTML pages load faster by loading all your JavaScript files  
asynchronously (in parallel) with the rest of your page. Normally if you include two or three scripts
in your page, the browser will wait for them to be executed before your page is shown.

By using NBL.js the browser can start showing the HTML while loading and executing the scripts, resulting 
in a faster, more responsive website. All in less than 1kb!

h3. Features

* Load scripts asynchronously or in order, or any combination of both
* Every script can have its own callback
* A callback for loading all items
* Can be mixed with your provided function for loading some data
* [TODO: Trigger a callback on a user definable timeout period]
* Uses HTML5's data attribute for configuration, so load all scripts with one script-tag
* Very small code!

h2. Usage

Include NBL.js in your pages and let it dynamically load all your JavaScript files by simply including 
the following tag:

@<script src="nbl.js" data-nbl="[ { load: 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js',
                                    then: ['jquery.lightbox.min.js', 'jquery.carousel.min.js' ],
                                    callback:function(e){ jquery_loaded(e) }
                                  },
                                  'http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js' ]"></script>@

This will do the following:

* It will load the latest version of jQuery.
* It will load the Urchin script from Google Analytics.
* After jQuery has loaded, it will start loading the jQuery plugins as defined after jQuery in parallel.
* When jQuery has loaded, it will call the @jquery_loaded()@ function.
* Finally, when Urchin has loaded, it will call the @urchin_loaded()@ function.

h2. Options

NBL.js is rather flexible in its options, so let's dissect a few examples.

h3. Loading three scripts asynchronously:

@[ 'script1.js', 'script2.js', 'script3.js' ]@

This will simply load all three scripts in parallel.

h3. Loading two scripts asynchronously, and two plugins asynchronously after the first script:

@[ {load:'script1.js', then:['plugin1.js', 'plugin2.js' ]}, 'script2.js' ]@

This will load @script1.js@ and @script2.js@ in parallel. After @script1.js@ has loaded, @plugin1.js@ and 
@plugin2.js@ will load in parallel.

h3. Loading four scripts in order:

@{ load:'script1.js', then:{load:'script2.js', then:{load:'script3.js, then:'script4.js } } }@

It's a bit crazy, but nesting the objects like this will allow you to load all scripts sequentially. 

h3. Three scripts with their own callbacks:

```@[ {load:'script1.js', callback:function(e){ script1_callback(e) }},
   {load:'script2.js', callback:function(){ script2_callback() }},
   {load:'script3.js', callback:function(){ script3_callback() }} ]@```

h3. Two scripts and a plugin with their own callbacks:

```@[ { load:'script1.js',
     then: {load:'plugin1.js', callback:function(){ plugin1_callback() } },
     callback: function(e){ script1_callback(e) }
   },
   {load:'script2.js', callback:function(){ script2_callback() }} ]@```

h3. [TODO:] Defining a global timeout function and a new timeout:

@{ load: ['script1.js', 'script2.js', 'script3.js' ], timeout: function(){global_timeout()} }{@


h2. Alternative usage

If you prefer you can choose to simply include NBL.js in a single line in your HTML pages. This way you can 
save a HTTP-call from the browser, and it will only add 900 bytes to your HTML page. Simply include the code 
in @nbl.single.js@ into a @<script>@ tag at the end of your page, and replace @['your', 'scripts', 'here']@ 
with your own options.

You can't use the @data-nbl@ attribute of the script tag if you use this method.

h2. Final note

All options are *case-sensitive*, if you include a file called @urCHin.js@, the corresponding @nbl.q@ object 
will be @nbl.q.urCHin@. I advise you to simply use lowercase for all options.

If you do not specify any options in the script tag, NBL.js will instantiate the default @nbl@ object and will 
do nothing. You will have to do a manual @nbl.l( [ 'options', 'here' ] )@.

You can find more examples in the included @example.html@.

I hope you find NBL.js useful, thanks for reading this!

h2. NBL Plus: support for images and CSS *updated*

GitHub user Knowlecules mailed me with modifications to preload CSS and images using NBL.js. I've incorporated 
that code into @nbl.plus.js@ (and @nbl.plus.min.js@). Thanks to some additional bug squashing by Richard Lopes, 
the latest version of NBL Plus is now better than ever! Clocking in at 1154 bytes for the minified version and 
694 bytes for the gzipped one, there's no reason not to use NBL Plus for your asynchronous media loading needs.
